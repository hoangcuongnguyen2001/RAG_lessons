# Lessons about Retrieval Augmented Generation

**English:**

This is a compilation of notebooks about Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG); in which LlamaIndex will be used as an orchestrator for Llama 3 to understand documents.
The questions are in Vietnamese; the documents are written in either Vietnamese or English.

There would be 3 parts for our analysis:
- Native RAG system;
- Pre-retrieval and in-retrieval optimization for RAG;
- Post-retrieval optimization for RAG (using ColBERT reranker).

**Notes**: Our analysis was done with financial documents, but you could use it for other documents as you want!
